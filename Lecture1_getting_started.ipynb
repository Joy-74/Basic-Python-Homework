    "  - It's easy to install python packages with anaconda. In particular, in this quarter we will introduce some commonly used packages, including NumPy for scientific computing, Matplotlib for ploting, scikit-learn for machine learning.\n",
    "  - With Anaconda, you can create separate environments, with different versions of python and packages in each environments. \n",
    "  - Anaconda is free for students, academics, and hobbyists (at least for now).\n",

    "Intall Anaconda:\n",
    "  - Follow [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). You can scroll down to the bottom to see the installers for different systems.\n",
    "  - The graphical installers are more friendly for beginners. \n",

    "  - Jupyter notebooks are documents literally like \"notebooks\", which contain both computer code (e.g. python) and rich text elements (paragraph, equations, figures, links, etcâ€¦). \n",
    "  - Notebook documents are both human-readable documents containing the analysis description and the results (figures, tables, etc..) as well as executable documents which can be run to perform data analysis.\n",

    "Check [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks) for using Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code\n",
    "  - You don't need to learn everything for now. Read until \"Work with code cells in the Notebook Editor\" will be good enough. Also, you don't need to worry about exporting.\n",
    "  - Always be careful about your environment (and python version) when using jupyter. Check out top-right in VS Code.\n"
